      <h3 id="comparing-different-versions-of-a-webpage">Comparing different versions of a webpage</h3>

      <p>We sometimes use analytics to try out different versions of pages to see which work better for users (‘multivariate testing’). We’ll save a cookie so that you consistently see the same version when browsing GOV.UK.</p>

      <p>The cookie name will change but will be in the form ‘ABTest-[Test name]’ where the ‘Test name’ describes which part of GOV.UK is being tested.</p>

      <p>This type of cookie will usually expire after between 1 and 4 weeks, but this may be longer for more in-depth tests.</p>

      <p>If you have not opted in to this type of cookie, you’ll see the standard version of the page being tested.</p>

      <h3 id="javascript-detection">JavaScript detection</h3>

      <p>We measure how many people visiting GOV.UK are using JavaScript, so that the site works for as many users as possible.</p>

      <h2 id="cookies-that-help-with-our-communications-and-marketing">Cookies that help with our communications and marketing</h2>

      <p>Some GOV.UK pages may contain content from other sites, like YouTube or Flickr, which may set their own cookies. These sites are sometimes called ‘third party’ services. This tells us how many people are seeing the content and whether
        it’s useful.</p>

      <p>In addition, if you share a link to a GOV.UK page, the service you share it on (for example, Facebook) may set a cookie. We have no control over cookies set on other websites - you can turn them off, but not through us.</p>

      <h3 id="youtube-videos">YouTube videos</h3>

      <p>We use YouTube to show videos on some GOV.UK pages. YouTube sets cookies when you visit one of these pages.</p>
